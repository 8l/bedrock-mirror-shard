* Reflecting Syntax
  * Base Expressions vs. Uninterpreted Functions
    - What do we do if we see "f a b c" and we have never seen "f" before?
      - We need to extend the context with "f".
      - If we want to keep track of the variables that occur inside the
        expression, then we need to abstract "f" with respect to each of the
	variables this means that Uninterpreted Functions are simply a
	representation choice for uninterpreted bases.
  * The real problem seems to be about extending the context.
    - I have a reflected term indexed by a denotation function "d".
    - At this point, my world is closed wrt "d". 
    - If I see something that I haven't seen before, I can't reference it in
      a way that supports decidable equality.
